**# Data-Analyst-Project-Data-Preprocessing-and-Dashboard-Creation**

This project showcases my skills as a data analyst, focusing on data preprocessing and visualization. Using Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing and Power BI for dashboard creation, I transformed raw data into actionable insights.


Technologies Used
**Jupyter Notebook:** For data preprocessing, including data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
**Power BI**: To create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics and insights derived from the data.


**Project Steps**
**Data Acquisition:** Imported datasets relevant to the analysis.
**Data Preprocessing:**
Cleaned the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Performed data transformation to enhance data quality and structure.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends within the data.
Dashboard Creation:
Designed an interactive dashboard in Power BI that displays key metrics such as total balance, total customers, demographics, and average balance.
Used visualizations to effectively communicate insights derived from the analysis.
Features
Interactive visualizations to explore different aspects of the data.
Comprehensive metrics that provide a clear overview of key performance indicators (KPIs).
User-friendly interface for easy navigation and interpretation of data insights.
Installation and Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the preprocessing steps.
Open the Power BI file to view the dashboard.
